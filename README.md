# ASSIGNMENT ONE : RE-IMAGINED
This project began with a 30-minute video creation process after filming in music performance rooms. Subsequently, the video underwent editing, involving extensive brainstorming, trial and error, and the exploration of both good and bad ideas. Eventually, the concept of "RE-IMAGINED" emerged, focusing on the reinterpretation of sound in various contexts. Essentially, this concept revolved around our natural tendency to associate things with specific sounds, such as piano notes, drums, saxophones, or everyday occurrences like the sound of dropping an object, a creaking door, or rain.

Due to time constraints, we had limited shots for the video. However, we managed to feature two people playing different instruments (piano and drums) and swapped the sounds of the instruments. This idea led to the broader project concept: creating a venue or space where one could experience sound in entirely new ways. Everything within this space would generate unfamiliar sounds, deliberately creating a new experience. The standout idea was to design an "Escape Room" filled with various sound-producing equipment, each capable of producing unexpected and unconventional sounds. For instance, I envisioned replacing the creaking sound of doors with the sound of a zipper opening and closing by attaching a long zipper to the door hinge. Similarly, I imagined placing an electric piano on top of a grand piano's body, configured to produce the sound of drums, showcasing just a few ideas for this project.

As the project aimed to create an immersive audio experience, the website played a crucial role in advertisement. The main page featured a welcoming background video, showing various instruments in a B-Roll clip, along with a large title "RE-IMAGINED". Below the title, I introduced the concept: "Escape room * Audio experiences," accompanied by an interactive "Book now" button that changed colors when hovered over. Additionally, I designed a brand logo displayed in the top left corner of the page within a sticky navigation bar. This navigation bar included interactive buttons linked to different sections of the page, such as "Home," "About," "Experiences," and "Contact us." It remains fixed in place and moved along with page scrolling, revealing a translucent background only as the user scrolled down.

The "About" section, immediately following the home page, explained the concept of the "Experience," highlighting the thrilling challenge it posed to users' perception of sound. The subsequent section, "Experiences," marked a slight shift in the website's focus, expanding from just an escape room to "Escape room * Audio Experiences." Given audio's central role in the project, the website not only promoted the escape room but also featured different experiences like orchestral performances, a silent room, and a 360-degree immersive room. These four distinct experiences were presented as images that offered a sneak peek of each event. Hovering over an image triggered a description of the experience, and the image's appearance changed slightly to engage and interact with the user.

The final section of the page was the "Contact us" section, located in the footer, providing users with information about the location and contact details.

# Process:

Before I began coding, I had a rough plan sketched out in a wireframe. I initiated the coding process with a blank canvas, first incorporating the navigation bar at the top, complete with interactive buttons. Subsequently, I introduced a background video, followed by the inclusion of the title and the implementation of button interactivity. Afterward, I inserted the sections for "about," "experiences," and "contact us," and connected the buttons in the fixed navigation bar to each respective section on the page. Following that, I integrated the experiences section, complete with various interactive images and accompanying text. Lastly, I adorned the background with shooting stars.

# Reflection/ evaluation:

Throughout the course of this project, the conceptual direction changed multiple times as I explored different ways to promote the video. It was a very rewarding experience, although it took a lot of time to redo the page outline every time I came up with a different look for it. Nevertheless, I was able to achieve the project's visual concept that I had envisioned. 

In the future, I would like to add more pages to complete the website, further expanding its content and functionality to increase its overall value and impact.
